*   The idea came from my love for natural, traditional hair care remedies we’ve all grown up with in India. My goal is to bring back the goodness of coconut, olive, and almond oils in a way that feels genuine and relatable for today’s young, cultured women.


*   Style I’m Thinking of is Natural, traditional, and elegant. Nothing too loud or over-the-top—just something that feels warm and trustworthy.
